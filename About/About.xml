Adds doors that look like and blend in with walls, for secret passages, maintenance hatches, etc.

Adds a secret passage door for metallic, brick, plank, smoothed rock and rock surfaces and a wall connector for...well... connecting walls.
	
Update: updated the wall graphics to the 1.0 walls and added rock and smoothed rock hidden doors.
Update: updated to 1.1 and changed non material cost from a component to 5 steel.

Also, side note, the wall connector can be used for things other than connecting walls and secret doors, for example, connecting walls to vents and nutrient paste dispensers.
